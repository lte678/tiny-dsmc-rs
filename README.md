# Tiny DSMC-rs
This is a rust implementation of the DSMC0S.FOR code from "Molecular Gas Dynamics and the Direct Simulation of Gas Flows", G. A. Bird.
It simulates a dilute, non-equilibrium gas in a four-dimensional X, U, V, W state-space.

At this time, the code should be a compiling, semi-complete implementation but is **not tested**.

Have fun!
